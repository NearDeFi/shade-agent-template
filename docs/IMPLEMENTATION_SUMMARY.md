## Next Steps

### **Phase 1: IoTeX Contract Deployment** (Immediate)
1. **Deploy IoTeX contracts** on testnet and mainnet
2. **Update contract registry** with deployed addresses
3. **Test contract functionality** with basic operations
4. **Validate integration** with existing code

### **Phase 2: near-multichain Integration** (Short-term)

## Benefits Achieved

### ✅ **For New Developers:**
- **Zero deployment required** for EVM networks
- **Faster onboarding** with shared contracts
- **Consistent behavior** across all instances
- **Lower costs** through shared deployments

### ✅ **For Advanced Developers:**
- **Optional customization** via environment variables
- **Flexible configuration** for custom deployments
- **Full control** when needed
- **Easy overrides** for testing

### ✅ **For Repository Maintainers:**
- **Centralized control** over contract versions
- **Easier updates** with shared registry
- **Better testing** with consistent environment
- **Reduced complexity** in deployment process

## Cost Analysis

### **Shared Deployment Costs:**
- **IoTeX Testnet**: ~0.1 IOTX (~$0.01)
- **IoTeX Mainnet**: ~1 IOTX (~$0.10)
- **Total**: < $1 for both networks

### **Individual Deployment Costs (Avoided):**
- **Per developer**: $5-20 per chain
- **100 developers**: $500-2000 total
- **Time cost**: 30-60 minutes per developer

## Conclusion

The implementation of the **shared contract pattern** based on the near-multichain example provides:

1. **Optimal Developer Experience**: Zero setup for new users
2. **Flexibility**: Environment overrides for advanced users
3. **Maintainability**: Centralized control for maintainers
4. **Cost Efficiency**: One deployment vs. many individual deployments

This pattern ensures consistency across all EVM networks and provides a scalable approach for adding new chains to the ecosystem.

## Immediate Action Items

1. **Deploy IoTeX contracts** (one-time task, ~$1)
2. **Update contract registry** with deployed addresses
3. **Create IoTeX component** for near-multichain
4. **Test integration** thoroughly
5. **Submit PR** to near-multichain repository

The foundation is now in place for a robust, scalable multi-chain implementation following proven patterns from the ecosystem.
